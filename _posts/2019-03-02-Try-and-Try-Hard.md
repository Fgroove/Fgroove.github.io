*The greatest Kindness will not bind the ungrateful.*

## Try and Try Hard

---

If you're going to try, go all the way. Otherwise, don't even start.

If you're going to try, go all the way. This could mean losing girlfriends, wives, relatives, jobs and maybe your mind. Go all the way.

It could mean not eating for three or four days. It could mean freezing on a park bench. It could mean jail. It could mean derision, mockery, isolation.

Isolation is the gift. All the others are a test of your endurance, of how much you really want to do it. And, you'll do it, despite rejection and the worst odds. And it will be better than anything else you can imagine.

If you're going to try, go all the way. There is no other feeling like that.

## Youth

---

Youth is not a time of life; it is a state of mind;

it is not a matter of rosy cheeks, red lips and supple knees;

it is a matter of the will, a quality of the imagination, a vigor of the emotions;

it is the freshness of the deep springs of life.

Youth means a temperamental predominance of courage over timidity, of the appetite for adventure over the love of ease.

This often exists in a man of sixty more than a boy of twenty.

Nobody grows old merely by a number of years.

We grow old by deserting our ideals.

Years may winkle the skin, but to give up enthusiasm wrinkles the soul.

Worry, fear, self-distrust bows the heart and turns the spirit back to dust.

Whether sixty or sixteen, there is in every human being's heart the lure of wonders, the unfailing child-like appetite of  what is next, and the joy of game of living.

In the center of your heart and my heart there is a wireless station;

so long as it receives messages of beauty, hope courage and power from man and the Infinite, so long as you are young.

When the aerials are down, and your spirit is covered with snows of cynicism and the ice of pessimism, then you've grown old, even at twenty, but so long as your aerials are up, to catch the waves of optimism, there is hope you may die young at eighty.
