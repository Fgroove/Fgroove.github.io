## If today were the last day of my life

---

For the past 33 years, I've looked in the mirror every morning and asked myself:"If today were the last day of my life, would I want to do what I'm about to do today?" And whenever the answer has been "No" for too many days in a row, I know I need to change something.

Remembering that I'll be dead soon is the most important tool I've ever encountered to help me make the big choices in life.  Because almost everything - all external expectations, all pride, all fear of embarrassment  of failure - these things just fall away in the face of death, leaving only what is truly important.
