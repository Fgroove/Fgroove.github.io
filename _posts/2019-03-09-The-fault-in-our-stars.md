# The fault in our stars

*By John Green*

## Quote 

```plain
As long as either of us is alive, I will be your father.
```

还是看不下去书，尝试失败！

## CHRISTOPHER POINDERTRA

```plain
Whenever I am away from you, the distance between us a burdensome thing,
I always think of you in colors, the smell of coffee as you so proudly make it for me,
the perfect sunlight spilling in through the window.

I miss you even when you are beside me.
I dream of your body even when you are sleeping in my arms.
The words I love you could never be enough.

I suppose we'll have to invent new ones.
```

## "IT IS HERE" BY HAROLD PINTER

```plain
What sound was that?

I turn away, into the shaking room.

What was that sound that came in on the dark?
What is this maze of light it leaves us in?
What is this stance we take, to turn away and then turn back?
What did we hear?

It was the breath we took when we first met.

Listen. It is here.
```

##  “VALENTINE” BY JOHN FULLER

```plain
The things about you I appreciate
May seem indelicate:
I’d like to find you in the shower, And chase the soap for half an hour.
I’d like to have you in my power, And see your eyes dilate.
I’d like to have your back to scour, And other parts to lubricate.

Sometimes I feel it is my fate To chase you screaming up a tower
Or make you cower By asking you to differentiate Nietzsche from Schopenhauer.
I’d like successfully to guess your weight And win you at a fête.
I’d like to offer you a flower.

I like the hair upon your shoulders, Falling like water over boulders.
I like the shoulders too: they are essential.
Your collar-bones have great potential
(I’d like your particulars in folders Marked Confidential).
I like your cheeks, I like your nose, I like the way your lips disclose
The neat arrangement of your teeth (Half above and half beneath) In rows.

I like your eyes, I like their fringes. The way they focus on me gives me twinges.
Your upper arms drive me berserk. I like the way your elbows work.On hinges …
I like your wrists, I like your glands, I like the fingers on your hands.
I’d like to teach them how to count, 
And certain things we might exchange, Something familiar for something strange.
I’d like to give you just the right amount, And get some change.

I like it when you tilt your cheek up.
I like the way you nod and hold a teacup.
I like your legs when you unwind them. Even in trousers I don’t mind them.
I like each softly-moulded kneecap. I like the little crease behind them.
I’d always know, without a recap, Where to find them.

I like the sculpture of your ears.
I like the way your profile disappears Whenever you decide to turn and face me.
I’d like to cross two hemispheres And have you chase me.
I’d like to smuggle you across frontiers Or sail with you at night into Tangiers.
I’d like you to embrace me.

I’d like to see you ironing your skirt, And cancelling other dates.
I’d like to button up your shirt. I like the way your chest inflates.
I’d like to soothe you when you’re hurt Or frightened senseless by invertebrates.

I’d like you even if you were malign, And had a yen for sudden homicide.
I’d let you put insecticide Into my wine.
I’d even like you if you were Bride Of Frankenstein
Or something ghoulish out of Mamoulian’s Jekyll and Hyde.
I’d even like you as my Julian Of Norwich or Cathleen ni Houlihan.
How melodramatic If you were something muttering in attics
Like Mrs Rochester or a student of Boolean Mathematics.

You are the end of self-abuse.
You are the eternal feminine.
I’d like to find a good excuse To call on you and find you in.
I’d like to put my hand beneath your chin, And see you grin.
I’d like to taste your Charlotte Russe,
I’d like to feel my lips upon your skin, I’d like to make you reproduce.

I’d like you in my confidence.
I’d like to be your second look.
I’d like to let you try the French Defence, And mate you with my rook.
I’d like to be your preference
And hence
I’d like to be around when you unhook.
I’d like to be your only audience,
The final name in your appointment book, Your future tense.
```
