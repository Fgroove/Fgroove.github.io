The foundation of knowledge must be laid by reading. General principles must come from books, which, however, must be brought to the rest of real life.

## The Best Advice You'll Ever Hear! -- Will Smith
```plain
You don't try to build a wall.
You don't set out to build a wall.
You don't start there.

You say:"I'm gonna lay this brick as perfectly as a brick can be laid. There will not be one brick on the face of the earth, that's gonna be laid better than this brick that. I'm gonna lay in this next ten minutes."

You do that every single day -and soon you have a wall.
It's difficult to take the first step when you look how big the task is.
The task is never huge to me.
It's always a brick.

What happen is ... we make the situation more complex.
You know, the normal among among us make it more complex.

99% of people are not willing to do what it takes to make their dreams come true.
Self-discipline is the center of all material success.

Failure is a massive part of being able to be successful.
You have to get comfortable with failure.
You have to actually see failure.
Failure is where all the lessons are.
You know, you go to the gym and you work out, You're actually seeking failure.
You want to take your muscles to the point where you get to failure because that's where the the adaptation is.
That's where growth is.

The Marines have a saying:"everybody wants to go to Heaven, but nobody wants to die", and. . . That's just real.
At the center of bringing any dream into fruition is self-discipline!

You know, something as simple as food and eating is not about your body as much as it is about your mind.
It's getting command of your mind to be able to choose actions that are in your own best interest.

Every day we are choosing sh#@, that's not in our own best interest, right?
So, if the world is attacking you and the world wants to fight you and the world's trying to hold you down.
So you don't kick yourself in the balls then you will stop yourself from getting what you dream.

Greatness is not this wonderful esoteric, illusive, godlike that only the special among us will ever taste, you know?
It's something that truly exists in all of us.

There's a certain delusional quality that all successful people have to have.
You have to believe that something different than what has happened for the last 15 million years of history.
You have to believe that something different can happen.
I truly, honestly, as I sit here before you right now, as. . .
Honestly as I can say it to you - I truly believe that I can be the president if I wanted to.
This is what I believe and I'm willing to die for it.
If you believe"Thou Shalt Not Lie", you either believe it or you don't.

Being realistic is the most commonly travelled road to mediocrity.
You cannot win the war against the world, if you can't win the war against your own mind!
