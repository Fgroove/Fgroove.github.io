```plain
But in herself alone she is more important than all the hundreds of you other roses:

because it is she that I have watered;

because it is she that I have put under the glass globe;

because it is she that I have sheltered behind the screen;

because it is for her that I have killed the caterpillars (except the two or three taht we saved to become butterflies);

because it is she that I have listened to, when she grumbled, or boasted, or even sometimes when she said nothing.

because she is my rose.
