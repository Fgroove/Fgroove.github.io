# TOO FAR
## my feel
```plain
Anyway, it's a great work!
I love the song, especially its melody and the vioce of anna. 
The voice is so amazing, as if touching the silk when I was listening the song.
It give me a feel that I am in another world, just like walking throug a path in a forest, with the sunshine.
There is a agreeable comment about this song - "this song makes me feel the chills", not because it is cool, it reminds me of somthing of sorrow, makes me feel lonely, let me wanna cry.
It give me a feeling or a illusion that I were in another world, a peaceful world, a silent world, a world just me myself there.

I was living alone in Japan when I listened this song for the first time. Therefore, it gave me loneliness, the memory of that days, that days just like in a dream.
