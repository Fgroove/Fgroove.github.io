# All Falls Down
---
Nature and human life are as various as our several constitutions.

## All Falls Down

```plain
What's the trick I wish I knew
I'm so done with thinking through
All the things I could've been
And I know you wonder too
All it takes is that one look you do
And I run right back to you
U crossed the line
& it's time to say F U
```

```plain
What's the point in saying that
When U know how I'll react
U think u can just take it back
But shit just don't work like that
You're the drug that I'm addicated to
And I want you so bad
Guess I'm stuck with you
And that's that
Cus when it all falls down then whatever
When it don't work out for the better
If we just ain't right and it's time to say goodbye
When it all falls down
When it all falls down
I'll be fine
I'll be fine
You're the drug that I'm addicated to
And I want you so bad
But I'll be fine
```



Alan Walker

```plain
Why we fight I don't know
We say that hurts the most
On I try staying cold
But you take it personal
All this firing shots
And making grounder
```

Both

```plain
It's way too hard to cope
But I still can't let you go
```

Noah Cyrus

```plain
Cus when it all falls down then whatever
When it don't work out for the better
If we just ain't right and it's time to say goodbye
When it all falls down
When it all falls down
I'll be fine
I'll be fine
You're the drug that I'm addicated to
And I want you so bad
But I'll be fine
```
