# Task 2

### a wide variety of friends and acquaintances VS a small group of close friends

This is a quite complicated question. It really depends on the very motive behind your making friends. 

If you want to improve yourself, it is much better to get in touch with a wide range of friends and acquaintances because by having access to a wider and more diverse social network, you could make progress in various aspects, like you may be capable of meeting people who are older than you and they could offer you the wisdom of their life experience.

Nevertheless, if you would love to vent your emotions, a small and closer friend is always a better choice. When being in front of your close buddies, you just can be yourself and don't have to care too much about what you say and do. Everything that you express and convey would't hurt any of your practical interest. It's just a way of relief and relaxation. 

Therefore, to be with which sort of friends is up to your true need.
