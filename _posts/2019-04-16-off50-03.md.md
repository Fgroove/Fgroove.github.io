# Task 3

## Explain Why the man agree with the professor's opinion

In the reading, one professor proposes that school shouldn't spend money purchasing a new lighting system because of two reasons. 

The first reason is that this new lighting system is too costly and this amount of money could be used to do other meaningful things. 

Yhe second is that this new lighting system is too bright and it may interface with school's academic project. 

In the listening, the man approves of the professor's proposal.

The first reason is that it is better for the school to spend the money finishing the library renovation, which is more urgent.

And secondly, the students and their astronomy professor are recording a comet through a telescope. If this system is installed, it will make the sky at night too bright and the whole recording would be impossible to finish.

Therefore, because these two reasons the man agrees with the professor's proposal letter.
