# Task 1

## Give advice to help your friend avoid being late.

Well, if one of my friends cannot do things on time, I would like to give some suggestions to him as follows. 

Firstly, set an alarms as possible as he can. Once he has an important schedule, an alarm gives him a reminder on time not tobe late.And what is more, he can set the voice of alarm loud so that he will not forget.

Secondly, ask somebody else to do things together. As we all know, doing things together with others rather than alone is kind of like intangible force.

To sum up, these are two of the advice that I can give to him.
