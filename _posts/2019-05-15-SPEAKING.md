## Speaking Task 2

### Question

Some people prefer playing team sports. Other prefer physical activities that you do alone, such as swimming or running. Which do you prefer? Explain why.

### Choosing one from two
● Personally, I prefer [playing team sports]…

● I’d rather [play a team sport]…

● If I had to choose between [team sports and exercising alone], I’d…

● If you ask me, [team sports] are better because…

● Between [team sports] and [exercising alone] , I’d rather…

### Giving Examples

● For example,…

● Take, for example, [noun].

● For instance,…

● If…., say,…

### Answer 1

**Between** team sports **and** exercising alone, **I'd rather** exercise alone,  **personally.** **If you ask me,** it's better because you can do it any time, **for one**. **For example,** if I wanted to get some exercise, but I only played team sports, I’d, uhh, I’d have to call friends or, I don’t know—or find a group of people who played regularly. **But on the other hand,** if I want to go running, I can
just go any time. **Also**, I can listen to music while running or hiking. You need to talk, to, uhh… to communicate when playing a team sport, so you can’t do that… you can’t wear headphones at all. **In general**, I guess I just like exercising alone better, **because** I have more control of when and what I do.

### Answer 2

**If I had to choose between** team sports **and** exercising alone, **I'd** definitely play a team sport, like volleyball, my favorite. It’s more enjoyable to spend time with people. **There are a couple of reasons I say that.** When you’re, uh, with people, you can share it… share the experience, **for one**. **I mean**, you can talk, or maybe joke, like, uhh… , **if** you’re playing volleyball, **say,** and you make a mistake—you drop the ball , for instance —your friends can reassure you. **But besides that**, friends can help motivate you. When you’re exercising alone, on the other hand ,
you need to motivate yourself. So, uhh… **my main point is that** exercising with people makes the time spent more fun.

### Sample Answer 1

**The announcement told us that** next year, students will have to pay to park cars— **that is**, park near the class buildings, specifically. People will need to register their cars in order to park there. **But** one of the students… the man in the conversation… he believes that it’s a bad decision. **He says that** the university isn’t going to make money, because the money students pay will be spent on additional security to check that cars in the lots are uhh, paid for… **I mean**, that they’re registered. **More importantly**, **he believes** that students will be upset, and **although** the school will write tickets to punish unregistered cars, the students aren’t, uhh, aren’t gonna pay them. **Basically, the student is of the opinion that** the school is going to create dissatisfaction without gaining anything, **while** they could instead just keep the current system.

### Sample Answer 2

**According to the text**, there’s a new policy on campus parking, and students are gonna need to register their cars. **What’s more,** they’ll have to pay a fee to be allowed to park in the lots near the classroom buildings, and, uhh… . **the reading states that** the fee is going to provide extra money for the school to spend on building more parking lots. **But the male student,** **on the other hand, disagrees that** the school will actually be able to earn any money. **He claims** that the expenses of the new registration system, will… are gonna cost too much, so **in his eyes** the registration system can only create problems. **While the text** says that students who don’t register will be fined, **the student points out** that security won’t know who unregistered cars belong to, **so he claims that** people won’t pay the fines.
